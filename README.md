Handwritten Tamil letter recognition is a fundamental task in pattern recognition and language processing, aiming to automatically interpret and transcribe handwritten Tamil characters into digital text. While traditional methods have made significant strides in this field, the emergence of deep learning, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), has sparked new avenues for enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of handwritten Tamil letter recognition systems.

## About
Traditional methods for handwritten Tamil letter recognition often rely on feature engineering and handcrafted feature extraction techniques, which may not fully capture the nuances and variations present in handwritten characters. CNNs offer a promising alternative by automatically learning discriminative features directly from raw pixel data, thereby potentially improving recognition accuracy and robustness. Motivated by the need for more accurate and efficient handwritten Tamil letter recognition systems, this project aims to explore the application of CNNs in this domain. By harnessing the power of deep learning and CNN architectures, we seek to develop a robust and scalable system capable of accurately recognizing handwritten Tamil characters across various writing styles and variations. Through extensive experimentation and evaluation, we aim to demonstrate the effectiveness of CNN-based approaches in addressing the challenges posed by handwritten Tamil letter recognition, thus contributing to the advancement of pattern recognition and language processing technologies.

## Features
* The project is implemented by python using the following libraries:
PyTorch
PIL (Python Image Library)
* Collect a dataset of handwritten Tamil characters. Ensure that each image is labeled with the corresponding Tamil character.
* Preprocess the images, which involves resizing, normalization, and augmentation to enhance model performance. 
* Use a framework like PyTorch to build and train your model.
* Split your dataset into training, validation, and testing sets.
* Evaluate the trained model on the test set to assess its performance metrics such as accuracy, precision.
* Create a Flask web application to deploy your model.
* Preprocess the input data similar to how you preprocessed your training data.
* Use your trained model to predict the Tamil characters present in the input.
* Display the predicted characters along with the confidence.
* Deploy your Flask application on a web server.
